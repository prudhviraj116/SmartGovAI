SmartGovAI - Privacy & Data Protection Approach\n\n- Data minimization: only fields required for analytics retained.\n- Pseudonymization: personal identifiers replaced with hashed tokens; mapping stored securely.\n- DLP/redaction: automated detection and removal of phone numbers and IDs from free text.\n- Aggregation & differential privacy: public dashboards expose aggregated metrics only.\n- Access control & encryption: use Cloud IAM least-privilege, CMEK for sensitive storage.\n
